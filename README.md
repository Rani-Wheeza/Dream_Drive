# Dream_Drive

Dream Drive is an experimental project that transforms user-described dreams into interactive 3D scenes using AI and Unity. The goal is to creatively blend natural language, procedural generation, and surreal environments to let people explore their subconscious in a playful, personal way.

Current Status

In early development

The project is currently in the planning and prototyping stage. I’ve created:
A few Unity prefabs (e.g., terrain objects, props)
Some basic test scripts to begin connecting dream data to scene elements
A working GPT prompt structure for parsing dream descriptions into structured data (JSON format)
More development coming soon!

Goals
- Let users input a dream description via voice or text
- Use GPT to extract core elements: environment, mood, objects, etc.
- Generate a playable scene in Unity based on those elements
- Optionally add sharing features or dream galleries

Tools & Tech Stack
- Unity (3D, C#)
- OpenAI GPT API – for dream parsing
- Whisper – for speech-to-text input
- Figma – for UI mockups
- Firebase – for user-generated dream storage

Screenshots / Demo (Coming Soon)
Check back here for visuals and short clips once I implement the first interactive scenes.

Roadmap
- [x] Create prefabs and test scripts
- [ ] Connect GPT dream parser to Unity
- [ ] Build scene generation logic
- [ ] Add player controller and camera system
- [ ] Build simple UI for dream input
- [ ] Launch basic playable demo
